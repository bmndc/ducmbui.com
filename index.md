## what I'm probably working on

- Set up and self-host services on my own domain
- Develop a [revival fork of Mammoth](https://git.sr.ht/~ducmbui/mammoth), a Mastodon client for Apple devices
- Learn React and TypeScript to build a web client for Lemmy that mimics 2018 Reddit UI design
- Rewrite documentation on [the BananaHackers website](https://bananahackers.net) and maintain [BananaHackers Store](https://store.bananahackers.net)
- Watching the [Internet Archive's microfiche scanning live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxUjwZYBIUs)
- Get ready for the capstone courses

Contributing to projects: [joelacus/RedditEnhancer](https://github.com/joelacus/RedditEnhancer), [Just the Docs Jekyll theme](https://just-the-docs.com)

Or I might procrastinate and watch a lot of YouTube videos instead.
