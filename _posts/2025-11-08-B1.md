My entire Docker setup experienced some downtime yesterday. I did some weekly maintenance, as usual, upgrading the `linux-aarch64` kernel to 6.17.7. What I wasn't aware however, the pre-compiled version of the new kernel omitted the `raw` table from `iptables`, preventing Docker from dropping incoming connection to the container system.

6.18rc seems to have reverted this, but with the move from legacy `iptables` to `nftables` I decided to replace `iptables` with `iptables-nft` and restarted the Docker service. All good now.

Maybe I shouldn't live life on the bleeding edge...
