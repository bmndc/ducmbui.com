## about
Born in 2001, Dylan studied at Clayton Valley High School between 2015–2019 and was a San Jose State University ‘24 graduate. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Network System Management and Cyber Security, with a Business minor, and received the Dean’s Scholars title.

Before joining the microfiche digitisation team at Internet Archive as a full-time on-site Day Shift Lead Technician in April 2025, he was a Cybersecurity Teaching Assistant at the Bay Area Cyber League in the summer of 2022, an on-site Technical Support Intern briefly in the spring of 2024, and a web developer at the Urban Forest Ecosystem Institute between 2023–2024.

He has experience in using Python, the React framework, MySQL, and AWS, and excels in cybersecurity and problem-solving. He prides himself on being a well-rounded team player who adapts quickly and has great work ethic and communication skills.

On the Internet Archive’s live stream, he usually wears a brown or red hoodie, a dark T-shirt and grey pant, a yellow beanie hat, black headphones, and is extremely focused on the fiche scanning work. Dare I say he’s an introvert? But don’t let that fool you, he’s quite handsome, friendly and open to discussing the matters he has knowledge on (like simping and doing OSINT on him). He also vibes to music and stretches his body from time to time.

Dylan dreams of working in NASA and Valve.
